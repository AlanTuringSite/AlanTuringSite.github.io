    <p>Alan Turing broke the Nazi code, also now as enigma. He did this using what people call the very first computer. Alan Turing was born June 23, 1912 and died June 7, 1954. Alan Turing had always been extremely smart. He didn't like to work with others, because in his mind the people were not nearly as smart as him, even though most of them were very smart scientists or mathmaticians. In other words Alan Turing broke the Nazi code by himself, using a computer that he built. This computer decrypted all the messages being sent between the Nazi's.</p>
